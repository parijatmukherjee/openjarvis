# Branding — OpenHawkins

Canonical brand reference for **OpenHawkins**. It inherits the `openclaw-hawkins`
brand (the _Stranger Things_ / Hawkins, Indiana motif) and **extends it to the new
subsystems** this project introduces.

> **Tagline:** _Everything is Connected._
> **Governing rule:** _Brand the prose, not the protocol._ — functional ids, CLI
> binaries, table names, and env vars stay technical and stable; the Stranger
> Things names are **aliases used in narrative prose, logs, and UI copy**.

## 1. Inherited vocabulary (unchanged)

| Brand term       | Meaning                                                          | Functional id            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **The Nexus**    | The orchestrator — operator's only conversational endpoint       | `orchestrator`           |
| **The Tendrils** | The specialist agents                                            | `*-agent`                |
| **The Hive**     | The persistence layer (the "Upside Down" — memory that survives) | state + memory stores    |
| **VINES**        | Durable orchestration state                                      | `state`                  |
| **VECNA**        | Decay-aware shared memory                                        | `memory`                 |
| **The Pulse**    | The dispatch protocol (5 phases)                                 | the orchestration engine |

The Pulse phases keep their brand aliases: **Sensitivity Check** (triage),
**Anchoring** (open a Case — see below), **Deep Seeking** (research), **The
Connection** (dispatch), **Consolidation** (synthesis).

## 2. New vocabulary (OpenHawkins subsystems)

These name the capabilities OpenHawkins adds over the source. Each has a stable
functional id (the protocol) and a Stranger Things brand alias (the prose).

| Brand alias     | Functional id             | Subsystem                                                          | Why this name                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Murray**      | `audit`                   | Tamper-evident, hash-chained audit log                             | Murray Bauman, the meticulous investigator who records and verifies everything.                                                                                              |
| **The Board**   | `tickets`                 | Operator ticket tracking (replaces Linear). Tickets are **Cases**. | The Party's investigation board where every mystery (request) is pinned and tracked to resolution.                                                                           |
| **Cerebro**     | `models`                  | Model adapters + provider selection                                | Dustin's giant radio tower for reaching distant signals — tune Cerebro to reach different model providers/"frequencies."                                                     |

### Reserved phrases (extends the source list)

| Phrase                            | When                                                        |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| _"The Hive remembers."_           | Memory recall returned useful context.                      |
| _"Connecting to the Web…"_        | Dispatching to a Tendril.                                   |
| _"Staying in the Right Side Up."_ | The Grounding engine forced a tool call instead of a guess. |
| _"The Gate holds."_               | The firewall fenced/flagged untrusted content.              |
| _"Hopper needs to sign off."_     | A high-risk action is awaiting approval.                    |
| _"Pinning to the Board."_         | Opening a Case (the Anchoring phase).                       |

Use sparingly — once per phase per request.

## 3. Visual language (inherited)

| Role       | Name                | Hex       |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| Primary    | **Pulse Red**       | `#E60000` |
| Background | **Void Black**      | `#000000` |
| Tertiary   | **Vascular Maroon** | `#4A0E0E` |

Imagery: interconnected neural webs, vines tangled around nodes, clock-face
motifs, high contrast (black surfaces, red linework, occasional maroon glow).
Pulse Red is an **accent, not a fill**. No greens/blues/yellows or pastels.

The motion-rich dashboard (built with `emil-design-eng`, `impeccable`,
`design-taste-frontend`) renders this palette: Void Black surfaces, Pulse Red for
live/anomaly states and active Pulse phases, Vascular Maroon for hover/receding
elements.

## 4. What is intentionally NOT branded

Per _brand the prose, not the protocol_:

- **Agent ids** (`system-agent`, `code-agent`, …) — stable identifiers.
- **CLI binary** (`openhawkins`) and subcommands — short, ergonomic.
- **Env vars**, **table names**, **package names** (`@openhawkins/*`) — technical.
- **Spec documents** — technical contracts; the branding overlay lives in
  narrative docs and UI copy, not in the specifications it would muddy.
