# OpenHawkins — Design & Plan

**Date:** 2026-06-05
**Status:** Draft for review
**Author:** Parijat Mukherjee (with Claude)
**Source pattern:** [`openclaw-hawkins`](../../../openclaw-hawkins) (multi-agent orchestration on top of the OpenClaw runtime)

---

## 1. One-paragraph thesis

OpenHawkins is a self-owned AI-agent platform. Where `openclaw-hawkins` is an
_orchestration layer that rides on top of the external OpenClaw runtime_ (it
shells out to `openclaw agent --agent <id> --message …`), OpenHawkins **owns the
runtime itself** — the agent loop, model adapters, the tool/skill engine, durable
state, shared memory, the chat channels, and the dashboard. The Hawkins pattern
(Nexus + Tendrils + VINES + VECNA) becomes the _core_, not a plugin. The guiding
principle: **the runtime enforces what OpenClaw left to the LLM's discretion** —
tool-calling, grounding, state transitions, memory injection, permissions, and
concurrency. The model proposes; the runtime enforces.

## 2. Goals & non-goals

### Goals

1. **Own the runtime.** No dependency on the external OpenClaw gateway.
2. **Kill hallucination at the root** via a runtime-enforced _Grounding_ system
   (the user's #1 pain point: models hallucinate when they don't use tools, even
   with clear skill instructions).
3. **Cross-platform, installs anywhere, works perfectly** — Windows, macOS, Linux.
   No hard MariaDB dependency; zero-config default.
4. **Telegram + Discord native** as first-class chat channels.
5. **Beautiful, motion-rich dashboard** (Astro) replacing the Linear dependency
   for operator oversight — built with the `emil-design-eng`, `impeccable`, and
   `design-taste-frontend` skills.
6. **Feature parity with the openclaw-hawkins pattern**: Nexus orchestration,
   6 Tendrils, durable state (VINES), decay-aware memory (VECNA), operator
   oversight.
7. **Learning, auditable, shareable, ecosystem-compatible** — v1 ships
   deterministic replay + an eval harness, a per-Tendril learning loop, exportable
   "Pulse replay" artifacts, and `SKILL.md` skill-marketplace compatibility
   (§10.1). The platform improves over time, can prove what it did, and plugs into
   the existing skill ecosystem.
8. **Security & trust as a core pillar** — encrypted secrets, RBAC + sandboxing,
   prompt-injection defense, session integrity, tamper-evident audit, runtime-
   enforced approval, and identity disclosure (§5.5). Safety lives in the runtime,
   below the model — never in a config flag or a prose rule.
9. **Keep the strengths** of the source repo: TypeScript, strict typing, high
   test coverage, clean module boundaries.

### Non-goals (for v1)

- Writing a model _inference_ engine. We sit on top of provider SDKs
  (Anthropic / OpenAI / Ollama) and own everything _above_ the raw model call.
- A general-purpose agent _framework_ for third parties (we may expose a plugin
  API later, but v1 is a product, not a framework).
- Voice channels, mobile apps (future).
- Distributed/multi-host clustering in v1 (single-host daemon; design leaves the
  door open via pluggable Postgres/MariaDB state).

## 3. Problems with OpenClaw / the source architecture (and how OpenHawkins fixes each)

This is the analysis the project was started to produce. Each problem below is
derived from reading the `openclaw-hawkins` source (`src/dispatcher.ts`,
`orchestrator/AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, `vines/`, `vecna/`).

| **P1**  | **Models hallucinate when they don't call tools**, even with clear skill instructions.                                                                                       | Skills/`AGENTS.md` are _passive prose_ injected into context.

| **P2**  | **Dispatch is subprocess-based and fragile.** `dispatchSpecialist` runs `openclaw agent … --json`, parses stdout.                                                            | Brittle: PATH/ENOENT, JSON parse failures, 16 MB buffer cap, no streaming, timeout = SIGTERM kill, no mid-flight cancellation.                                                                             | **In-process dispatch** over a typed message bus.

| **P10** | **No typed tool contract at the engine boundary.** Tool calls are free-form bash via `exec`; TypeBox validation exists only inside the plugin.                               | Tools aren't first-class at the runtime.                                                                                                                                                                   | **Typed tool registry.** Every tool has a JSON-schema (TypeBox/Zod) for args + result; the runtime validates both directions and feeds schemas to the model as native tool definitions.                                                                                                     |

| **P13** | **Credential & data exposure.** Secrets/API keys in plain-text `.env` under `~/.openclaw`; documented active exploits; no encrypted storage.                                 | No secrets management.                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Encrypted credential vault.** Secrets live in the OS keychain (macOS Keychain · Windows Credential Manager · libsecret) or an age/libsodium-encrypted vault unlocked by a master key — **never plaintext on disk**. Optional 1Password/Vault backends. Config files refuse secret values. |
| **P14** | **No access-control boundaries (no RBAC).** Granting the agent your creds gives it all your permissions; a compromised agent moves laterally — its shell is your shell.      | No privilege separation.                                                                                                                                                                                   | **RBAC + least-privilege isolation.** Per-agent roles and capability grants (extends P8). Tendrils run in constrained sandboxes (restricted child process / OS sandbox / optional container), **not** as ambient you. Default-deny; explicit scoped grants only.                            |
| **P15** | **Indirect prompt injection.** External content (WhatsApp/web/email/attachments) carries hidden instructions the LLM treats as system commands.                              | No data/instruction separation.                                                                                                                                                                            | **Untrusted-content firewall.** All externally-ingested content is fenced as _data, never instructions_, with provenance tags. Injection heuristics + a "tainted input ⇒ side-effecting actions require approval" rule. Tool calls triggered by tainted content are gated and logged.       |

## 4. Architecture

A single TypeScript monorepo (pnpm/npm workspaces), distributed as a
**single binary per OS**. Everything in-process; the only external processes are
optional (an Ollama server, an opt-in Postgres/MariaDB).

### 4.2 Why in-process beats subprocess dispatch

The single biggest structural change from the source. Subprocess dispatch
(`execFile('openclaw', …)`) cannot stream, cannot cancel cleanly, caps output at
16 MB, and turns every failure into an opaque exit code. In-process agents share
a typed event bus: the orchestrator sees every token and tool call live, can
cancel, can enforce concurrency, and never parses stdout. The
`DispatchResult` contract from the source survives as a typed interface.

---

## 5. The Grounding engine — the anti-hallucination centerpiece

This is the feature that directly answers the user's pain point. It is a stack
of runtime-enforced layers, not a prompt.

1. **Native tool-calling, not prose.** Tools are registered with JSON schemas and
   handed to the model via provider-native function/tool-calling
   (Anthropic tool use, OpenAI tools, Ollama tool calling). The model emits a
   structured tool call; the runtime validates args against the schema and
   executes. No "remember to run `df`" hope-and-pray.

2. **Tool-required skills.** A skill manifest can declare
   `grounding: required` (optionally naming specific tools). For such a task the
   runtime **will not accept a final answer until at least one qualifying tool
   call has succeeded.** If the model tries to answer first, the runtime injects
   a corrective turn: _"You must call `<tool>` before answering."_

3. **Claim-citation verification.** For factual/data answers the final message
   must reference tool-result IDs. A cheap verification pass (rules + a small
   model) checks that asserted facts trace to a tool output. Ungrounded claims
   are flagged, and the runtime either strips them or forces a re-grounding turn.

4. **Structured outputs.** When the answer is data (a status, a count, a table),
   the runtime forces a JSON-schema response so the model fills fields from tool
   outputs rather than composing prose it can fabricate.

5. **Explicit "unknown" path.** Skills instruct: _prefer calling a lookup/search
   tool, or return `unknown`, over guessing._ The runtime treats a grounded
   "unknown" as success, not failure — removing the incentive to fabricate.

6. **Model tiering.** Grounding-critical tasks route to stronger models; cheap
   local models handle only low-stakes chat. The adapter layer makes tier a
   policy, not a hard-coded model id.

7. **Optional verifier agent.** For high-stakes orchestrations, a second pass
   (separate agent) adversarially checks the first's claims against tool outputs
   before the Nexus reports — mirroring the "verification-before-completion"
   discipline.

**Acceptance test for the Grounding engine (Subproject 1 exit criteria):** a
deliberately under-instructed agent asked a question it would normally fabricate
(e.g. "how much disk is free?") must be _unable_ to answer without calling the
disk tool, and its answer must cite the tool result — verified by an automated
test on all three OSes.

---

## 5.5 Security, Trust & Safety model

OpenClaw's most serious failures are not functional — they are security and
trust failures (P13–P22). OpenHawkins treats security as a **core runtime
pillar**, designed alongside the Grounding engine, not bolted on. The unifying
principle mirrors Grounding: **the runtime enforces safety; it is never left to
the model's discretion or a config flag.**

The model can be tricked (prompt injection), the daemon can run unattended, and
plugins are untrusted — so the safety boundary lives in the runtime, below the
model.

### 5.5.1 Secrets — encrypted, never plaintext (P13)

- Secrets resolve from the **OS keychain** (macOS Keychain · Windows Credential
  Manager · Linux libsecret/Secret Service) or an **age/libsodium-encrypted
  vault** unlocked by a master key/passphrase.
- **Config files refuse secret values** (continues the source's secrets policy,
  hardened). Nothing sensitive is ever written plaintext to `~`.
- Optional enterprise backends: 1Password CLI, HashiCorp Vault.

### 5.5.2 Privilege separation & RBAC (P14)

- **Least privilege per agent.** Each Tendril/plugin gets a typed capability
  grant; the runtime denies anything outside it (shared mechanism with §8.5.3).
- **Sandboxed execution.** Tendril tool handlers run in constrained workers
  (restricted child processes; optional OS sandbox/container) — the agent's shell
  is **not** the user's shell.
- **RBAC roles** map operators → permitted agents/tools/approval authority, so a
  compromised agent can't move laterally.

### 5.5.3 Untrusted-content firewall — prompt-injection defense (P15)

- All externally-ingested content (chat messages, web pages, files, attachments)
  is **tagged with provenance** and **fenced as data, never instructions** in the
  prompt assembly layer.
- **Taint rule:** any action _influenced by_ untrusted content that is also
  _side-effecting_ (send, delete, pay, exec) is force-gated through an approval
  step and audit-logged — even in autonomous mode.
- Injection heuristics flag suspicious instruction-like patterns in ingested data.

### 5.5.4 Session integrity (P16)

- **One writer per session.** Each session is a serialized actor over the
  event-sourced log; transitions are transactional with idempotency keys and
  optimistic locking. Parallelism is _across_ sessions, never _within_ one — so
  async tool calls can't corrupt session state.

### 5.5.5 Tamper-evident audit (P17)

- An **append-only, hash-chained** audit log records every decision, tool call,
  state transition, approval, and outbound message. Integrity is verifiable;
  the log is exportable for compliance and queryable/replayable in the dashboard.

### 5.5.6 Autonomy & approval (P18)

- Side-effecting actions are **risk-classified**. High-risk defaults to
  **human-in-the-loop**, enforced by the runtime — not a config flag the model or
  a misconfiguration can bypass. Approval surfaces as a channel button (Telegram/
  Discord) or a dashboard prompt. Dry-run mode and per-action autonomy policy.

### 5.5.7 Identity disclosure — anti-impersonation (P22)

- Outbound messages are **labeled/signed as the assistant** by default, never as
  the user — a runtime guarantee, not a prose rule. Per-channel disclosure config
  and a full outbound audit trail.

| --------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local attacker reading disk | Plaintext secrets           | Encrypted vault / OS keychain (§5.5.1)                    |
| Compromised agent           | Lateral movement            | RBAC + sandboxing (§5.5.2)                                |
| Malicious content author    | Indirect prompt injection   | Untrusted-content firewall + taint gating (§5.5.3)        |
| Malicious/buggy plugin      | Capability abuse            | Declared-capability sandbox + install disclosure (§8.5.3) |
| Unattended daemon           | Unapproved high-risk action | Runtime approval gates (§5.5.6)                           |
| Repudiation / debugging     | No trail                    | Tamper-evident audit (§5.5.5)                             |

These defenses are **designed in S1** (vault interface, capability model, taint
tags, single-writer sessions, audit log) so later subprojects inherit a safe
core rather than retrofitting one.

## 6. Cross-platform strategy

- **TypeScript everywhere**; single-binary build per OS (Bun `--compile` or Node
  SEA — decided in Subproject 1 after a spike; both keep the TS source).
- **Embedded SQLite default** (`better-sqlite3` or `bun:sqlite`) → no MariaDB
  install required. The source's MariaDB schemas port to SQLite; PG/MariaDB stay
  available via a storage-driver interface for multi-host operators.
- **OS-abstraction layer** in `core`:
  - platform detection; package-manager abstraction
    (`apt`/`dnf` · `brew` · `winget`/`choco`);
  - shell abstraction (bash/zsh vs PowerShell);
  - config/data dirs via OS conventions (XDG on Linux, `Library/Application
Support` on macOS, `%APPDATA%` on Windows).
- **`system-agent` becomes OS-aware**: the Linux-only "apt/systemd/ufw/cron"
  scope generalizes; the agent inspects the host and picks the right commands.
- **Installers:** Homebrew tap, Scoop/winget manifest, `curl | sh`, and `npm i -g`.

### 6.1 Model selection — free, cross-platform, chosen at setup (Cerebro + Mr. Clarke)

No paid account is required to run OpenHawkins. The **setup wizard ("Mr. Clarke")**
asks the operator to tune **Cerebro** (the model layer) to one of several free,
cross-platform options:

| Option                         | What                                                                                | Notes                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Local / Ollama** _(default)_ | Fully free, private, offline-capable; runs on Win/Mac/Linux                         | Wizard offers a small capable default (e.g. a Llama/Qwen-class model) and checks hardware                                                         |
| **Ollama cloud** _(v1)_        | Ollama-hosted models (e.g. the source's `…:cloud` tags) — no local hardware needed  | Same Ollama adapter/API surface as local; user supplies an Ollama key, stored in **The Cabin**. Great for laptops that can't run big local models |
| **Free cloud tier**            | A provider with a no-cost tier (e.g. Google Gemini / Groq / OpenRouter free models) | User pastes a free API key; stored encrypted in **The Cabin** (§5.5.1)                                                                            |
| **Bring your own**             | Anthropic / OpenAI / any provider                                                   | Opt-in; unlocks stronger grounding-tier routing                                                                                                   |

The **Ollama adapter must support both local and `…:cloud` models in v1** behind a
single code path — local vs cloud is a config/endpoint choice, not a separate
integration (this mirrors how the source used `ollama/kimi-k2.6:cloud`).

The adapter layer is **provider-agnostic** — model choice is policy, not
hard-coded. **Important synergy:** weaker free models hallucinate _more_, which is
exactly why the **Grounding engine (Eleven, §5)** is mandatory, not optional — it
is the mitigation that makes free local models trustworthy. Grounding-critical
steps can be routed to a stronger model (incl. Ollama cloud) if configured.

### 6.2 Cross-platform tendrils (esp. `system-agent`)

The six functional ids are kept, but `system-agent` is redefined from Linux-only
sysadmin to an **OS-aware host agent**: it inspects the host and selects the right
package manager (`winget`/`choco` · `brew` · `apt`/`dnf`), the right shell
(PowerShell vs bash/zsh), and cross-platform service control — via the
OS-abstraction layer above. The other tendrils (`code`, `research`, `data`,
`comm`, `vision`) are already platform-neutral.

---

## 7. Channels: Telegram + Discord

- **Telegram** via grammY (modern, typed). **Discord** via discord.js.
- Each channel maps a chat/thread → an orchestrator **session** (multi-turn,
  resumable). Streaming replies (edit-in-place message updates as tokens arrive).
- **Approval gates** surface as inline buttons: the `comm-agent`'s "draft → send
  it?" becomes a Telegram/Discord button the runtime mediates — no auto-send.
- **Media passthrough:** images/files routed to the `vision-agent`.
- A `telegram` Claude-Code plugin already exists in this environment and can seed
  patterns (token storage, allowlist/policy), but OpenHawkins ships its own
  channel adapters.

---

## 8. Dashboard (Astro, motion-rich)

Built with the three installed design skills — **`emil-design-eng`** (motion &
polish), **`impeccable`** (anti-AI-slop design language), **`design-taste-frontend`**
(metric-based component architecture).

Views:

- **The Pulse board** — live orchestrations through the 5 phases (Sensitivity →
  Anchoring → Deep Seeking → Connection → Consolidation), animated transitions.
- **Tendrils** — per-specialist activity, current task, token/latency.
- **Memory (VECNA)** — browse/search fragments, importance, decay, evolution graph.
- **Traces & replay** — step through any orchestration; token + cost accounting.
- **Settings** — models, channels, capability/approval policy.

Design intent: real-time, fluid, sub-300ms interactions, custom easing, no
generic AI-dashboard look. Replaces Linear as the oversight surface (Linear/GitHub
become optional exporters).

---

## 8.5 Plugin system & marketplace

OpenHawkins is **extensible by design** and aims, in the future, to host a
**community marketplace** where authors submit plugins. This is not a v1
afterthought — it shapes the runtime now, because a stable, versioned extension
contract and a real capability sandbox must exist _before_ third-party code runs
on a user's machine.

### 8.5.1 What is a plugin?

A plugin is a versioned package that contributes one or more **extension points**:

| Extension point      | Example                                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tendril**          | A new specialist agent (e.g. `media-agent`, `devops-agent`) |
| **Tool**             | A typed, schema-validated capability an agent can call      |
| **Channel**          | A new chat front-end (Slack, WhatsApp, Matrix, SMS)         |
| **Model adapter**    | A new provider (Gemini, Groq, Bedrock, a local server)      |
| **Storage driver**   | A new state/memory backend (Postgres, Redis, S3)            |
| **Dashboard widget** | A new panel/visualization in the Astro UI                   |
| **Skill**            | A grounding-aware skill manifest (`SKILL.md`-compatible)    |

### 8.5.2 Plugin manifest

Every plugin ships an `openhawkins.plugin.json` (echoing the source repo's
`openclaw.plugin.json`) declaring:

- `id`, `version`, `author`, `license`, `description`;
- `contributes`: which extension points + entry modules;
- `capabilities`: the **declared permission set** it needs (`shell`, `network`,
  `filesystem:read`, `filesystem:write`, `send-message`, `model-call`, …);
- `config`: a JSON schema for its settings (secrets refused — env-only, per the
  source's secrets policy);
- `compat`: supported OpenHawkins version range.

### 8.5.3 Capability sandbox (the safety foundation — ties to P8)

Third-party code is **untrusted**. The runtime enforces:

- **Declared-capability gating.** A plugin can only use capabilities it declared;
  the runtime denies anything outside its grant at call time.
- **Install-time disclosure.** Before install, the user sees exactly what the
  plugin asks for — _"this plugin wants: shell, network, send-message"_ — in the
  CLI and the dashboard. No silent escalation.
- **Approval gates for side-effects.** Network/shell/send-message calls from a
  plugin route through the same runtime-mediated approval gates as the
  `comm-agent` "send it?" flow.
- **Isolation.** Plugin tool handlers run with a constrained API surface (no
  ambient `process`/`fs` access — only the injected, capability-scoped host API).

### 8.5.4 Loading & distribution (v1)

- **Local dir** — drop a plugin folder in the OpenHawkins plugins path.
- **npm** — `openhawkins plugins install npm:<pkg>`.
- **Skill compatibility** — read the same `SKILL.md` format the Claude `skills`
  CLI uses (the format used to install `emil-design-eng`, `impeccable`,
  `design-taste-frontend` for this very project), so the existing skill ecosystem
  drops in.

### 8.5.5 The marketplace (future phase)

A hosted registry (the OpenHawkins analogue of npm / the source's "ClawHub"):

- **Submission flow:** author publishes → automated **manifest validation** +
  **security scan** (static capability audit, dependency check) → versioned,
  **signed** package.
- **Trust & safety:** signed packages; capability disclosure surfaced at install;
  a review/curation process; report/takedown path; semver + deprecation.
- **Discovery:** browse/search in the dashboard ("Marketplace" view) and via
  `openhawkins plugins search <query>`; ratings, install counts.
- **Optional monetization** (paid/private plugins) — left open, not v1.

The marketplace is **deferred to its own phase (M1, §9)**, but the **plugin SDK,
loader, and capability sandbox are v1** so that everything above is possible
without a breaking redesign later.

## 9. Decomposition & build order

Each subproject gets its own spec → plan → implementation cycle. This document is
the umbrella; do **not** try to implement it all from one plan.

**Recommended next step after this plan is approved:** spec **S1** in detail, then
implement a walking-skeleton vertical slice that demonstrates the Grounding engine
ending hallucination on a real task.

## 10. Scope

### 10.1 Promoted into v1 (committed)

These four are **v1 features**, not future ideas — they are cheap to design in now
and expensive to retrofit, and together they make the platform _learning,
auditable, and shareable_. Each is anchored to the subproject that owns it.

- **Deterministic replay & eval harness** _(owned by S1, built on the event-
  sourced runtime)_ — every turn (prompt, tool call, tool result, model output) is
  recorded so any orchestration can be **replayed deterministically** to debug, to
  A/B a prompt/model change, and to regression-test agent behavior. The eval
  harness runs recorded scenarios as automated tests — and is the natural home for
  the **Eleven** grounding acceptance tests (§5). Builds directly on **Murray**
  (§5.5.5) and the trace store (P12).
- **Per-Tendril learning loop** _(owned by S2, **VECNA**)_ — memory fragments are
  tagged by tendril; on each dispatch the runtime auto-injects that specialist's
  own accumulated lessons, so each Tendril measurably improves its future
  grounding over time (closes the loop on P11). Includes a feedback signal from
  approval/audit outcomes back into fragment importance.
- **"Pulse replay" as shareable artifacts** _(owned by S5, dashboard)_ — export
  any orchestration as a **self-contained, animated HTML trace** (the Pulse phases,
  tendril dispatches, tool calls, grounding decisions) that can be shared/opened
  offline. Uses the same replay data as the eval harness.
- **Skill-marketplace compatibility** _(owned by S6, **The AV Club**)_ — read the
  same `SKILL.md` format the `skills` CLI uses (the format used to install
  `emil-design-eng` / `impeccable` / `design-taste-frontend` for this project), so
  the existing community skill ecosystem drops into OpenHawkins directly, and
  **Melvald's** (M1) can host them.

### 10.2 Future / not committed

- **MCP support** — OpenHawkins as both an MCP _client_ (consume external tools)
  and an MCP _server_ (expose Tendrils to other agents). Huge interop win.
- **Cost & token budgets per orchestration**, enforced by the scheduler (hard cap
  → graceful stop), surfaced live in the dashboard.
- **Local-first / offline mode** — fully functional with local Ollama, no cloud.

---

## 11. Decisions (resolved 2026-06-05)

1. **Binary toolchain — Bun `--compile`.** Confirmed lean; validate with a spike
   in S1 (fall back to Node SEA only if a native-dep blocker appears).
2. **Model defaults — free + cross-platform, chosen during setup.** No paid
   provider is required to run. The **setup wizard (Mr. Clarke / Cerebro, §6.1)**
   asks the user to pick from several free, cross-platform options; default is
   local **Ollama** (free, private, runs on Win/Mac/Linux). Paid providers are
   opt-in for those who want stronger grounding-tier models. See §6.1.
3. **Schema lib — Zod.** Chosen for DX and clean JSON-schema generation for
   native tool-calling (`zod-to-json-schema`). The TypeBox usages in the copied
   reference code are **migrated to Zod** during the port (we own the code now;
   we won't carry two schema libs). _Override possible if continuity wins._
4. **Tendril set — adjusted for cross-platform.** Keep the six functional ids, but
   redefine `system-agent` from Linux-only sysadmin to an **OS-aware host agent**
   (winget/choco · brew · apt/dnf; PowerShell vs bash; cross-platform service
   control). See §6.2.
5. **Linear — dropped.** Replaced by an **own ticket-tracking system, "The Board"**
   (functional id `tickets`; tickets are _Cases_), backed by the local SQLite
   store and surfaced in the dashboard. Optional GitHub/Linear _exporters_ may be
   added later, but they are never the source of truth. The Pulse "Anchoring"
   phase now opens a **Case on The Board** instead of a Linear ticket.
6. **License — MIT** (matches the source). `LICENSE` added.

> **Naming:** all subsystems keep the **Stranger Things** theme per
> [`docs/branding.md`](../branding.md) — e.g. the Grounding engine is **Eleven**,
> the firewall is **The Gate**, the sandbox is **The Lab**, the vault is **The
> Cabin**, approvals are **Hopper**, audit is **Murray**, tickets are **The
> Board**, models are **Cerebro**, channels are **Supercomm**, the plugin layer
> is **The AV Club**, the future marketplace is **Melvald's**, setup is **Mr.
> Clarke**. _Brand the prose, not the protocol._

## 12. What this plan deliberately keeps from `openclaw-hawkins`

- The **Nexus + Tendrils** mental model and the **5-phase Pulse**.
- **VINES** (durable state) and **VECNA** (decay-aware memory) as concepts — but
  reborn as runtime-owned, SQLite-default, auto-driven subsystems.
- The **TypeScript + strict-typing + high-coverage** engineering culture.
- The **Stranger-Things-flavored vocabulary** is optional branding; the protocol
  is the substance.
