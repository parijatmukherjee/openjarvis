# OpenHawkins

> Your own AI-agent platform — a self-owned runtime with the Hawkins multi-agent
> orchestration pattern at its heart. Cross-platform (Windows / macOS / Linux),
> Telegram + Discord native, with a beautiful real-time dashboard.

OpenHawkins is a ground-up rebuild of the [`openclaw-hawkins`](../openclaw-hawkins)
orchestration pattern that **no longer rides on top of an external runtime**.
Instead of shelling out to `openclaw agent …`, OpenHawkins owns the whole stack:
the agent loop, the model adapters, the tool/skill engine, durable state, shared
memory, the chat channels, and the dashboard.

The headline goal: **make the runtime enforce what OpenClaw left to the model's
discretion** — tool-calling, grounding, state transitions, memory injection,
permissions, and concurrency. The model proposes; the runtime enforces. This is
how we kill the hallucination problem at the root.

## Status

🟡 **Planning.** Nothing is built yet. The design lives in
[`docs/specs/2026-06-05-openhawkins-design.md`](docs/specs/2026-06-05-openhawkins-design.md).

## The pieces (planned)

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `core` | Runtime: agent loop, model adapters, native tool-calling, **Grounding engine**, capability sandbox |
| `state` | Durable orchestration state (VINES reborn) — runtime-owned, SQLite-default |
| `memory` | Decay-aware shared memory (VECNA reborn) — auto-injected, SQLite-default |
| `orchestrator` | The Nexus — routing, dispatch, synthesis (logic in code, not prose) |
| `tendrils` | Specialist agents (system/code/research/data/comm/vision), in-process |
| `channels` | Telegram + Discord + CLI + WebSocket gateways |
| `dashboard` | Astro app — real-time, motion-rich (Emil Kowalski · impeccable · Taste) |
| `gateway` | The daemon tying it together |
| `plugin-sdk` | Public extension contract (Tendrils, tools, channels, adapters, widgets, skills) |
| `registry` | Plugin loader + capability sandbox + future marketplace client |
| `cli` | `openhawkins` cross-platform command |

A **community plugin marketplace** (the OpenHawkins analogue of npm/ClawHub) is a
planned future phase — authors submit plugins, the registry validates manifests,
security-scans capabilities, and signs packages. The plugin SDK and capability
sandbox are v1 so this is possible without a breaking redesign.

## Stack

TypeScript / Node everywhere · Astro dashboard · embedded SQLite by default
(no MariaDB requirement) · single-binary distribution per OS.

TBD (the source pattern is MIT).
